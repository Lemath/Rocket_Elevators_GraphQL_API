# Rocket_Elevators_GraphQL_API

this week we use GraphQl to use another more suitable technology to restore the data coming from two separate data sources in the same request.

The GraphQL Solution was to be able to respond to 3 main queries:
1. Retrieving the address of the building, the beginning and the end of the intervention for a specific intervention.
query GetIntervention{
  intervention(id: 1) {
    id
    start_time_and_date
    end_time_and_date
    address
  }
}

2. Retrieving customer information and the list of interventions that took place for a specific building
query GetBuilding{
  building(id: 2) {
    customer{
      id
      company_name
      company_email
      company_contact
    }
    id
    interventions {
      id
      start_time_and_date
      end_time_and_date
      address {
        number_and_street
        city
        country
        postal_code
      }
    }
    building_details {
      number_of_floors
      department
      year_of_construction
      maximum_number_of_occupants
      building_type
    }
  }
}

3. Retrieval of all interventions carried out by a specified employee with the buildings associated with these interventions including the details (Table BuildingDetails) associated with these buildings.

query GetEmployee{
  employee(id: 4) {  
    interventions {
      id
      start_time_and_date
      end_time_and_date
      address {
        number_and_street
        city
        country
        postal_code
      }
    }
    buildings{
      building_details{
        number_of_floors
        department
        year_of_construction
        maximum_number_of_occupants
        building_type
      }
    } 
  }
}
